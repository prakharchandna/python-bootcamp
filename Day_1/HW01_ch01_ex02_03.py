# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
# Python's syntax for math operations is almost the same as
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect.
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?

# Insert Answers
# Average Pace (minutes & seconds per mile): [answer here]
# 6.887096774193549 minutes per mile
# 413.2258064516129 seconds per mile
# Average Speed in MPH:  [answer here]
# 8.711943793911008 mph


# Insert calculations below (paste from the interpreter):
# average pace in minutes per mile
averagePace = (42 + 42/60)/(10 * 0.62)
# average pace in seconds per mile
averagePace = ((42 + 42/60)/(10 * 0.62))*60
# average speed in miles per hour
averageSpeed = (10 * 0.62)/((42 + 42/60)/60)
