# command line
- why?
- how?
- let’s start...

# the file system
- `ls` or `dir` list files
- `cd`          change directory
- `mkdir`       make directory
- `cd` or `pwd` present working directory

# little things
- `clear`
- `history`
- `↑`
- `[control + C]`
- `[tab-autocompletion]`
- `whatis COMMAND`
- `man COMMAND`
  - `q`

# little things - practice
- `whatis whatis`
- `man whatis`
- `whatis man`
- `man man`

# the file system - practice
| | |
--- | ---
|`$ pwd`  | # print the working directory |
|`$ cd ..`| # change directory parent dir |
|`$ pwd`  | # print the (new) working directory |
|`$ cd /` | # change directory to root dir (/) |
|`$ ls /` | # list files in root directory (/) |
|`$ cd`   | # change directory to home dir |
|`$ ls`   | # list files in directory |

# practice: interacting with files
- `$ pwd`           # we’re in our home directory
- `$ mkdir this`

Remove that directory.

- `$ rm this`       # failed. files may exist
- `$ rm -r this`

### Think Python: 2.3 Expressions and statements
> An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators.

> A **statement** is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.

# bitwise operators
### Think Python: 1.4 Arithmetic operators

Finally, the operator ** performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:  
> >>> 6\*\*2 + 6  
> 42  
In some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:  
> >>> 6 ^ 2  
> 4  
I won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators>.  

*Note: Below we will see `^` as a Boolean operator.*

### Stack Overflow: ["Real world use cases of bitwise operators"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2096916/real-world-use-cases-of-bitwise-operators)

### Python Docs: [15. Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) (again)
> While pathological cases do exist, for most casual use of floating-point arithmetic you’ll see the result you expect in the end if you simply round the display of your final results to the number of decimal digits you expect.

### Python Docs: [6.1.3. Format String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/string.html#formatstrings)

# python - history and philosophy
- Guido van Rossum (BDFL):

> Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas…

- Notes:
  - scripts
  - objects
  - functions
  - `import this`
    - [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
    - PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal

# variables
## variable types
- a variable can be a boolean:
  - `True`, `False`
- a variable can be an integer:
  - `4`, `-17`, `0`,  `4034282792`
- a variable can be a floating point:
  - `4.1`,  `-17.00000023`, `0.0`, `4.034E9`

### strings
*Note: strings are immutable: cannot be mutated, or changed*

- `"Proxima"`, `'Michael'`
- `"Michael says this is a string"`
- `'Proxima says "this too"'`
- `"Daniel: \"and more strings!\" "`
- `"21"` or `'21'`    # Strings, not integers
- `"Monty Python'`  # SyntaxError


### variables as containers
*(we'll come back to these later)*

- objects:  (user created data type)
  - containers of strings, ints, objects, etc.
  - created by you or imported with a library
- collections:  strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries.
  - called "data structures", these are "native"
  - containers of other strings, ints, objects

### variable names
*Note: can't start w/ numbers, can't use **Python keywords***

- Java and C++ are “strongly typed”
  - i.e they make authors declare var. type
    - `int fahrenheit = 72`
- Python is loosely typed and has no such worries

```
>>> temp = 72
>>> Temp = 80
>>> print(str(temp) + " " + str(Temp))
```

# Python keywords
## Python Docs: <https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords>

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/keyword.html>

```
>>> import keyword
>>> print(keyword.kwlist)
['and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'exec', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'print', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
```

# types and properties
add integers

```
>>> 3 + 4
7
```

cannot add strings, rather: concatenate strings

```
>>> "I <3" + " Berkeley"
'I <3 Berkeley'
```

find types

```
>>> type(7)
<type 'int'>
>>> x = 'this is a string'
>>> type(x)
<type 'str'>
```

find properties

```
>>> dir(7)
['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__class__', '__cmp__', '__coerce__', '__delattr__', '__div__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__float__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', '__getattribute__', '__getnewargs__', '__hash__', '__hex__', '__index__', '__init__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__long__', '__lshift__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__nonzero__', '__oct__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdiv__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', ...
```

*Note: `dir()` is a built-in function*

try

```
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> pprint(dir(7))
```

# mis(using) types & properties: test

>>> print(tmp)
█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
>>> tmp = 4
█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █

█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
```

# mis(using) types & properties: results
```
>>> print(tmp)
NameError: name 'tmp' is not defined
>>> tmp = 4
>>> print(tmp)
4
>>> print(tmp + 3)
7
>>> print(tmp + " apples")
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
>>> print(str(tmp) + " apples")
4 apples
>>> tmp = "apples"
>>> print(tmp)
'apples'
```

# Python style
- readability
- requires common indentation in code-blocks (functions, if-else, loops)

```
if (good_indentation == True):  
  print("these statement are")
  print("properly indented")

if (good_indentation == False):  
   print("neither statement is")
      print("properly indented") #IndentationError
```

# Python functions
```
>>> def function_name():

>>> def sum_two(a, b):
...     return a+b

def test_scope():
    x = 10
    print(x)

def main():
    x = 4
    test_scope()
    print(x)
```

```
def test_scope(x):
    x = 10
    print(x)

def main():
    x = 4

>>> answer = sum_two(1,2)
>>> answer

>>> print(function_name())
Hello World!
None
```

# structure
we import 'modules' to gain new functions and var. types

- *Note: we imported `keywords` and `pprint` earlier, some of you imported `math`.*


```
import math # Imports are at top of files [in-line comment]
import antigravity

# Functions are in the middle.
def main():
    print(“Code to execute”)

# Boilerplate calls main() at end of file.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
<!-- Reference for boilerplate: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do -->


# math
- `import math`
- `dir(math)`

```
# Importing the math gives you more functions (operations).
>>> math.sqrt(9)    #3
>>> math.fabs(-23.7)  #23.7
>>> x = float('NaN')  #NaN = Not A Number
>>> x = x + 4     
>>> math.isnan(x)   #True
```

modulo (`%`) “yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second” ([the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#index-55))

```
>>> 0 % 3
0 
>>> 1 % 3
1
>>> 2 % 3
2
>>> 3 % 3
0
>>> 4 % 3
1
```

- use `//` to get the integer quotient
```
>>> 2//3
0
```

dividend = divisor * integer quotient + remainder  
`2 = 3 * 0 + 2`

# if-statements
- inevitably, events occur that should be handled differently.
  - missing argument, file doesn't exist, expected value.
  - the impossible happened.
  - supporting contingency
- handle such events with If-Statements.
  - provide a different flow through your program.
  - can be nested.
- three key keywords:  `if`, `elif`, `else`.

## if-statements - examples
[IN TERMINAL]

# performing comparisons
- checking for equality
```
3 == (1 + 2)  # True
"Me" == "me"  # False
```
- checking for inequality
```
3 != (1 + 2)  # False
"Me" != "me"  # True
```
- comparing magnitude
```
3 >  (1 + 2)  # False
3 <  (1 + 2)  # False
3 >= (1 + 2)  # True
```

# Boolean logic
- Boolean (logical operator) 
- Boolean = OUTPUT 
- logical operators:
  - `and` = both must be true
  - `or`  = at least one must be true
  - `^`   = (exclusive or) exactly one must be true

(`and not` = not)

# Boolean logic quiz
- `if (True and True)`
  - `True`
- `if (True and False)`
  - `False`
- `if (True or False)`
  - `True`
- `if (True ^ True)`
  - `False`
- `if (False ^ False)`
  - `False`
- `if (True and not True)`
  - `False`
- `if (True and not False)`
  - `True`
- `if (True and (True or False))`
  - `True`
- `if (True ^ False)`
  - `True`
- `if (False ^ True)`
  - `True`
- `((True ^ (True and False)) or ((True or False) ^ (not False)))`
  - `True`

# loops
- problem 1: 
  - build a recommendation system:
    - compare each movie-rating to all other movie-ratings
- problem 2:
  - analyze results from a survey:
    - how do you find all fields with no input?
- the cornerstone of let me do this simple task over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...

```
# Here is a loop to create "over and" programmatically.
for n in range(10000):
    print("over and ")
```

# loops v. recursion?
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15688019/recursion-versus-iteration>

> Write iterative programs for algorithms best understood when explained iteratively; write recursive programs for algorithms best explained recursively.

Ex. `is_palindrome`?

# loops - `for` and `while`
- two loop types:
    - `for` loops are good for known quantities; countable
    - `while` loops are good for unknown or infinite; uncountable

# loops - `for`

```
for tweet in survey:
    print(tweet)
```

---

Notional example: there are 100K tweets in my survey, how many were retweets?

```
for tweet in survey:
    if tweet['retweet'] == True:
        rt_count = rt_count + 1
print(rt_count)
```

```
for idx in range(len(survey)):
    if survey[idx]['retweet'] == True:
        rt_count = rt_count + 1
print(rt_count)
```

---

Practice example:


# loops - `while`
Notional example: modeling a vehicle: the trip and MPH dashboard

```
secs = 0
dist = 0
while(engaged):
    secs = get_time_elapsed()
    rotations = get_tire_rotations(secs)
    dist = dist + get_dist(rotations)
    mph = get_mph(rotations, secs)
    print("mph = " + mph, "dist traveled = " + dist)
```

---

Practice example:

# loops - `break` statement
"breaks out of the smallest enclosing `for` or `while` loop."

```
count = 0
while (True):
    count = count + 1
    if (count >= 10):
        break
    print("tick tock")
```

# loops - `continue` statement
"continues with the next iteration of the loop"


```
count = 0
while (True):
    count = count + 1
    if (count % 2 == 0):
        continue
    if (count == 10):
        break
    print("tick tock")
```

```
def find(word, letter):
    index = 0
    while index < len(word):
        if word[index] == letter:
            return index
        index += 1
    return -1
```


# loops - `else` clause
> executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with `for`) or when the condition becomes false (with `while`), but not when the loop is terminated by a `break` statement

- Now we are going to check the Python Documentation for an example.
  - This is good practice. Ready...
