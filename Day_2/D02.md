# BDFL
Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, is often referred to as the BDFL — the Benevolent Dictator For Life.
 
# tabs or spaces? spaces around operators? Not for the aestheticially inclined only
- [PEP 8 aka The Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal
  - How many PEPs are there? It depends on their state. I've seen PEP 3100 (yes, we started counting at 0)
- PEPs you should probably know about
  - [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) *the style guide*
  - PEP 20 (`import this` on your interpreter) *the zen of python*
  - [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) *docstrings conventions*

# loops - `else` clause
> executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with `for`) or when the condition becomes false (with `while`), but not when the loop is terminated by a `break` statement

- Now we are going to check the Python Documentation for an example.
  - This is good practice. Ready...

- For reference, `else` is described here: 
  - Python Documentation: [4. More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)

# on debugging
  - What is a "syntax error"?
    - Think Python Appendix:

        > Syntax errors are discovered by the interpreter when it is translating the source code into byte code. They indicate that there is something wrong with the structure of the program. Example: Omitting the colon at the end of a `def` statement generates the somewhat redundant message `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

  - Think Python 3.12 Debugging:
  
    > As [PERSON] pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”


  - Think Python 5.12 Debugging:

    > When a syntax or runtime error occurs, the error message contains a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are usually:  
    > • What kind of error it was, and  
    > • [?????].

# input and dubious debugging
```
>>> user_number = input("enter a number: ")
enter a number: 3
>>> user_number
'3'
>>> type(user_number)
<class 'str'>
```

```
>>> a = "4"
>>> b = "4"
>>> c = "3"
>>> a > b+c
False
>>> a > c+b
True
```

# comments & docstrings

comment your code such that you (at a later point in time) or a teammate can understand your code better
 ```
 	def complex_function(parameter_1, parameter_2):
 		# this complex function does something cool. here's the summary
 		... well written code ensues ...
 ```

why are docstrings cool?
    
```
        def get_quotient(dividend, divisor):
            """returns the result of division from two arguments:

            Arguments:
            dividend -- the number being divided (number)
            divisor -- the number doing the dividing (number)
            """
            return dividend/divisor

        quotient = get_quotient(2, 10)
```

## Python Documentation: [5.8. Comparing Sequences and Other Types](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-types)
> Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses *lexicographical* ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison;

```
>>> ord(a)
52
>>> ord(c)
51
>>> chr(51)
'3'
```
## Python Documentation: [2. Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

### [`ord(c)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord)
> Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character. For example, `ord('a')` returns the integer `97` and `ord('€')` (Euro sign) returns `8364`. This is the inverse of `chr()`.

### [`chr(i)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr)
> Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i. For example, `chr(97)` returns the string `'a'`, while `chr(8364)` returns the string `'€'`. This is the inverse of `ord()`.

```
>>> for number in range(33,100):
...     print(number, chr(number))
```

# getting user input
## during execution
use `input()`

```
user_age = input('What is your age? ')
next_age = int(user_age) + 1
print("Current age is " + user_age)
print("Next year, you'll be " + str(next_age))
```

`input()` will accept input until the first newline (`'\n'`). basically, until you hit enter.

---

## from command-line

```
$ python myapp.py ARG1 ARG2 ARG3
```

```
import sys

def main():
    print(sys.argv, type(sys.argv))
    print(len(sys.argv))
    print(sys.argv[0])
    print(sys.argv[1])
```

---

### what if there is no cmd-line input?

```
$ python myapp.py
```

```
def main():
    # Expects parameters (1,2)
    print(sys.argv, type(sys.argv))
    print(len(sys.argv))
    print(sys.argv[1])
    print(sys.argv[2])
```

---

```
$ python myapp.py
```

```
def main():
    # Expects parameters (1,2,3)
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        sys.exit("C'mon, use ALL the params")

    print(sys.argv, type(sys.argv))
    print(sys.argv[1])
    print(sys.argv[2])
    print(sys.argv[3])
```

# jupyter notebook!
- So what is a notebook?
  - Runs a local server on your system
  - Greater control over execution of code
  - Documentation made easy
- How should we install Jupyter?
  - The easy way - Anaconda; a package that comes with a lot of packages as a part of the installation. Cons: bloated, can mess up paths, etc
  - The painful way - `pip3`
 https://jupyter.org/install

# strings
## slicing
- strings are a "string" of characters.
  - i.e. bananas is, roughly, 'b' 'a' 'n' 'a' 'n' 'a' 's'
- we can "index" into strings (known in Python as slicing)

```
x = "UC Berkeley"
x[0]    # ?
x[1]    # ?
x[0:1]  # ?
X[0:2]  # ?
x[2:6]  # ?
x[-4:]  # ?
```

---

```
x = "UC Berkeley"
x[0]    # 'U'
x[1]    # 'C'
x[0:1]  # 'U'
X[0:2]  # 'UC'
x[2:6]  # ' Ber'
x[-4:]  # 'eley'
```

---

## string methods

- Python Documentation: [4.7.1. String Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
  - Ex: `rjust`

```
x = "UC Berkeley  "
x.replace("UC","University of California,")
x.split()    # ?
x.split('k') # ?
x.strip()    # ?
```

---

```
x = "UC Berkeley  "
x.replace("UC","University of California,")
x.split()    # ['UC', 'Berkeley  ']
x.split('k') # ['UC Ber', 'eley  ']
x.strip()    # "UC Berkeley"
```
# try-except
- Think Python: [14.5: Catching exceptions](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2015.html#toc158)
- Python Documentation: [8.3. Handling Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions)

---
- has no impact on “normal” case.
- handle events (input, errors) gracefully.  
- lots of exceptions exist...
    - couple dozen built-in

```
try:
    # Insert code block here, e.g. input
except Exception:
    # Code to handle exception
```

# try-except - `finally`
Python Documentation: [8.6. Defining Clean-up Actions](https://docs.python.rg/3/tutorial/errors.html)

> A `finally` clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not.

```
try:
    # file = open(sys.argv[1])
    # data = read_data(file)
except IOError as ioe:
    # handle error
except Exception as e:
    print "unknown err:", type(e), e, e.args
finally:
    # if (file is not None): close(file)
```

# try-except - practice

start a new script

```
n = int(input('Enter a # '))
print(n)
```

- run it
  - try entering a string, e.g. "abc"

# return
- Think Python: [6. Fruitful Functions](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2007.html)
- Python Documentation: [7.6. The return statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return)

```
def print_word(word):
    print(word)

def question_everything(word):
    questioned = word + '?'
    return questioned
```

## Loops exercises
- Write a function that prints the integers 0 through 99 sequentially in a ten by ten grid.


Ex:

```
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 15 15 16 17 18 19
```

## Loops 2
- Write a function that asks the user for numeric input and then calculates the average of those numbers. The function should keep asking for input until the user types `‘done’`.
  - Please do not import additional modules or libraries for this.

# lab time
- get started on homework
**partner exercise `D02_ex00.py`**
- create a program
  - creates a random integer from 1 - 25
  - asks the user to guess what the number is
  - validate input is a number
  - tell the user if they guess correctly
    - if not: too high/low
  - only let the user guess five times
    - then end the program  
- put your first PR in
